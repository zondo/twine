* TODO Convert maze to Harlowe 3

Is it the tw-link function that changed?  Try debugging in inspector window.

The tw-link element has passage-name attr in v2, but not v3.  How can click
be invoked?  Matching text would work, but it's a mess of quote chars.

* TODO Fix image centering

Replace

	(set: _img to '<center>' + _img + '</center>')
	(print: _img)

with

        (align:"=><=")+(box:"X")[(print: _img)]
