      They looked carefully at the bronze doors, trying to choose.  The
      uncertainty of visitors is one of my little pleasures.

      "It's easy to get lost," I said helpfully.  "This can be a sinister
      place."  The sun glared at me through the gateway.

      Something was ringing behind one of the doors.  They spent some time
      trying to decide which door it was, not understanding that the
      silences of the Maze are as eloquent as the sounds.

      "Decisions, decisions," one said.  "Too many decisions."

      "The story of my life," said another.

      "We don't want to be late," said a third, opening one of the doors.

      "Nary a soul to be seen," said the first, peering into the gloom.

      I waited patiently for them to choose which was to go... into...

      The floorboards creaked and groaned; the plaster made a gritty sound.
      They studied the old frescoes for clues but missed the obvious signs.

      "Are we on the right path?" they asked.

      Keeping in mind what a relative term "right" is, I assured them they
      were, indeed, on the right path.  As for the "correct" path of the
      "most appropriate" path...  Well, that might be something else.

      Full of confidence now they marched out to...

      The group complained of feeling "all turned around," as well they
      might.

      Because no one wanted to stay here very long they missed the real
      sign while looking through the obvious.  People in their situation,
      confronted with a challenge, tend to accept the terms of the
      challenge as a given, without examining it from all sides.  How many
      sides does that problem have?  They don't know.

      We passed down a long flight of stairs, through some sort of pantry,

      "What a foolish face," I snorted.  "Pay no attention."

      A sound made them all turn suddenly.  A small black cat ran out of a
      door to my right, sniffed at us, and, before I could move, ran out of
      the hall.  It was fortunate that I was still standing with the rest
      of them or they might have noticed.

      Faint voices came down one of the corridors.

      "Shall we toss a coin?" I asked.  "Or have you made up your minds?"

      They hadn't made up their minds, and they had no coins.  By a process
      of elimination they decided to go to...

      "Are these real?" they asked.

      I told them the trees were as real as anything else in the House.  As
      this was an important decision I encouraged them to take their time.
      After all, the more they think about the possibilities the more
      choices they have to make.  What were their chances of choosing
      wisely... one in four?  Two in four perhaps, if I was generous about
      it... and why not be generous?  There are one hundred ninety doors in
      this part of the House, counting the gate... enough for everyone.

      Making a choice, they entered a very long, dark corridor and at last
      came out into...

      Even I was oppressed by the weight that hung over our heads.  A very

      Standing in the light one of them put his hand out.  "I think it may
      be raining out there..."

      They didn't like the look of the place.

      "You continue to judge everything by the way it looks!" I cried,

      Looking at the picture on the wall they decided it wasn't a very good

      One of them almost fell over something on the floor.  "Why don't they
      pick up after themselves?" he said, sounding like an old man.

      "Weren't you ever irresponsible?" I asked, thinking of my childhood
      and how wild I had been.

      Music was being played somewhere nearby.  We stopped to listen for a

      Leaning on the sacrificial tripod I was suddenly moved to say,
      "Perhaps these numbers relate to each other in some specific

      One of them sat on a marble bench after I politely pushed some
      flowers aside.  "Did you pick these for me?" she asked, looking me in

      last we saw the musicians themselves.  They were so involved they
      failed to hear us.  The music was suited to the scene -a moody,
      romantic melody.  We stopped to listen and I admit that I, too, was
      affected by the sound as well as by the spectacle of the masked
      players.

      One of the visitors noticed me listening.  "Beautiful music, don't
      you think?"  "It's not bad," I said stiffly.  "The viol brings the
      right sense of warmth to the piece, but the guitarist is overplaying
      his part.  Still, he adds a certain plangent brio to an otherwise
      introspective composition..."  Unwilling to interrupt the concert we
      slipped past the musicians into the door to...

      "What is going on here?" they wondered.

      "Sometimes, important messages are couched in ambiguous terms," I
      said.  "That net may help you catch the answer to your question."

      They looked doubtful.  "We must look at this from all sides before we
      make a decision." At last, they were learning.

      They really couldn't decide which way to go; half of them wanted to
      go one way, half another.  They were close to splitting up when there
      was a rattling sound and one of the doors was shaken from the other
      side.

      They all stopped talking and moved closer together.  They soon agreed
      on a direction and we departed for...

      "No, that's a chopping sound," said another.

      None of them heard the faint jingling that came from behind the wall.

      It was surprising that he could identify any of the symbols, but I
      was relieved that he couldn't read them correctly.
